# HR_Dataset
This project is a Python/Excel-based HR data analysis and visualization focusing on workforce demographics, employee performance, satisfaction, recruitment, and attrition. The dataset contains employee records, including personal details, salaries, absences, performance scores, and recruitment sources.
The analysis is performed using Excel dashboards and visualizations, with the option to extend it in Python/Jupyter Notebook for deeper analytics.

 Features

Load and explore HR dataset (multiple sheets with KPIs, dashboards, and raw data).

Display employee details (Name, Department, Salary, Performance, Absences, Recruitment Source, etc.).

Perform descriptive statistics (mean, min, max, attrition rates, salary ranges).

Visualize data (department-wise distribution, gender analysis, attrition trends, satisfaction levels).

Identify top-performing employees and departments.

Explore absenteeism and salary comparisons across departments.

Clean and preprocess data for meaningful HR insights.
